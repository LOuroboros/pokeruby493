Major stuff:
-Add all or most of the Gen. 4 items.
-Add the targets, animations and effects for a lot of Gen. 4 moves.

Minor stuff/Reminders:
-Add gender differences.
-Add the remaining Gen. 4 abilities.
-Make a proper effect for the Razor Claw.
-Make a proper effect for Volt Tackle.
-Make Honey act like Sweet Scent in the overworld.
