-Make a proper effect for the Full Incense and the Razor Claw.
-Make a proper effect for Volt Tackle.
-Assign Adaptability to Porygon-Z (1st Slot).
-Assign Aftermath to Drifloon & Drifblim (1st slot), and to Stunky & Skuntank (2nd Slot).
-Fix an issue with the Bad Dreams ability (It doesn't work on Seedot).
-Make Iron Fist check for Bullet Punch and Drain Punch as soon as I add them.
