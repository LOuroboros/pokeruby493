# Pokeruby493

My goal with this project is to implement as many features from the Gen. 4 Pokémon Games (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver) as it's possible in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.

As it stands right now there is a lot of work to do. For more details, please refer to the [Project Related Docs Folder](https://github.com/LOuroboros/pokeruby493/tree/master/project%20related%20docs).
